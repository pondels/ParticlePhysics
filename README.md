# ParticlePhysics
This is a lovely physics engine where you can place balls in a window and watch them fly around!

Why are you standing there? Download the document! Everything that you see will be 100% found out by what you, the user find within this sandbox experience! You are meant to learn the world of 2 dimensional physics, while also being able to have unrealistic properties with said particles.

What happens when you ball has negative mass? What happens if you explode a particle in space? What happens if you have no gravity? The possibilities are limitless! Just be sure not to crash your computer! If you feel you have too many particles, there's that nifty clear window button on the bottom of the left bar.

That's all there is to say without giving away the first-time experience! The executable is linked [here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16L2aLDIgPRsO09yo8Ftjl1R_OYPdfRc_?usp=sharing)
